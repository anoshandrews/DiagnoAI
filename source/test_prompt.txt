Hi I'm Anosh Andrews and I am 23 years of age.I've been having back pain since the last 2 days due to excessive workouts at the gym where I lifted really heavy. NO medication taken. Sometimes muscles fatugue after workout but this feels a but more uncomfortable. The pain is just in the lower back muscles.Pain is only when I bend my back.Pain is only when I bend my back
